<!-- API-EVANGELIST-PROVENANCE:BEGIN -->
> ### About this repository
>
> **This is not our API.** This repository is an independent, third-party profile of a company's
> **publicly available** API surface, maintained by [API Evangelist](https://apievangelist.com).
> API Evangelist does not operate, host, resell, or support this company's APIs, and is not
> affiliated with or endorsed by the company unless stated on the profile.
>
> **Where the information came from.** Everything here is assembled from material a member of the
> public can reach with a browser and no credentials — the company's own website, developer portal
> and documentation, the specifications it publishes for public use (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema,
> `apis.json`, `llms.txt` and similar), its public repositories, and its public status, pricing and
> changelog pages. **Nothing here is obtained by breaching a system, defeating an access control, or
> using credentials of any kind.**
>
> **The rating is an independent assessment.** The Kin Score and Agent Readiness rating are
> independently calculated scores of a company's *public* API artifacts, produced by API Evangelist
> against a published rubric. They are not certifications, endorsements, security assessments, or
> audits, and they score published artifacts — not the quality, safety, or security of the software.
>
> **Corrections, re-scores, and removal are free.** No partnership, contract, or purchase is
> required, and you do not need to justify the request.
>
> - **Something wrong?** Open an issue on this repository, or email
>   [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com).
> - **Published something new?** Ask for a re-score and we will re-run the rating.
> - **Want the listing taken down?** Say so and we will honor it. The profile is reduced to your
>   company name, a factual description, and a link to your own site, and the company is recorded as
>   **unrated** — never scored zero for having asked.
>
> **Response times.** Acknowledgement within **one business day**; removal or restriction within
> **two business days**; corrections and re-scores within **five business days**.
>
> **Not from the company, and here with a question?** You are welcome here — we would rather be the
> front line and point you the right way than have a good report go nowhere. What this repository
> can answer is narrow, though, so it is worth knowing who you are actually looking for:
>
> - **A question about how the API works, an account, billing, or a bug in the service** — that is
>   the company's own support, not us. We profile this API; we do not operate it and cannot see
>   your account.
> - **A bug in an open-source project we only catalog** — file it on that project's own repository.
>   This has happened with a real and correct bug report that reached us instead of the people who
>   could fix it, which helped nobody.
> - **Anything about this listing itself** — the description, the tags, the rating, a missing or
>   wrong artifact — is ours. Open an issue here.
> - **Not sure, or something general about API Evangelist or APIs.io** — open an issue on the
>   [APIs.io Inbox](https://github.com/api-search/inbox) and we will route it.
>
> **This repository contains no software, and we will never ask you to download anything.** There is
> no build, release, installer, or binary here — only text and machine-readable API descriptions, so
> there is nothing here that can be "corrupt" or need "repairing". Any issue, comment, or email
> claiming otherwise and offering a download link is not from us and is hostile. Do not follow the
> link; it is a lure. Report it to GitHub and, if you like, tell us at
> [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) so we can take it down.
>
> **On a security or compliance team?** Email
> [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) with *security* in the subject line and
> you will get a person, not a form. We will tell you exactly which public URLs this profile was
> built from so your team can see the same surface we did, and we will take the listing down on
> request while you work through it.

Rain is an enterprise stablecoin payments platform that lets companies embed digital-dollar money movement into their products through a single API. Its infrastructure spans stablecoin wallets and virtual accounts, card issuing (Rain is a Visa and Mastercard Principal Member, settling Visa card transactions daily in stablecoins across multiple blockchains), and money movement via fiat on-ramps, off-ramps, and cross-border payment orchestration. Rain abstracts the back-end complexity of making on-chain stablecoins interoperable with traditional card networks, and maintains PCI DSS and SOC 2 compliance. Customers include Western Union, Nuvei, and ether.fi. Rain has raised over $338M, including a $250M Series C led by ICONIQ and a Series B led by Sapphire Ventures.

**Areas:** Stablecoins · Payments · Card Issuing · Fintech · Cross-Border Payments · Cryptocurrency · Wallets · Money Movement

The rubric is published at [github.com/api-evangelist/kin-score](https://github.com/api-evangelist/kin-score). The per-check breakdown behind these numbers — which checks were earned, partial or missed — along with score history and how this provider compares to its peers, is available at [apis.io/providers/rain/](https://apis.io/providers/rain/).

## How this profile is made

API Evangelist profiles a company's public API surface the way a developer would find it: the website, developer portal and documentation, the specifications it publishes, its public repositories, and its pricing, status and changelog pages. From that it derives the properties above — contracts split per API, workflows, schemas, collections, governance rules, plans and rate limits — and scores them against the published [Kin Score rubric](https://github.com/api-evangelist/kin-score).

The artifacts are published on [APIs.io](https://apis.io), not in this repository. This repository is the public record for Rain: the place to say something is wrong, missing or out of date, and to ask for a re-score or a removal.
